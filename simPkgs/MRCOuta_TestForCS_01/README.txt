Description of contents and instructions
---
Folder containing input files for simulations with ForCS for the MRC landscape Outauais. 

LANDIS version: v6.2

Beware that the simulation take about 3 days to run and the four output csv files can take up to 200GB of space 
(100 years, time step 5 years)

Other notes:
- 	The simulation does not require DOM&Soil spinup. Values of DOM&Soil pools at time 0 are already given in 
	ForC-succession-MRCOuta after having run the spinup once (see ForCS User Guide p.14)
- 	Many parameters in ForC-succession-MRCOuta are still preliminary or default (e.g., RootDynamics Table)
