Description of contents and instructions
---
Subfolders containing standalone simulation packages.

Ideally, use relative paths so that those packages are readily usable on other
systems.

Suggested folder name structure:
<simArea>_<shortDescrip>_<seqNum>
ex. MRCOuta_test_01/

Please include a 'readme.txt' file (like this one) in each simulation package
to provide any useful information, such as the LANDIS-II version for which the file
package was prepared.

For any question or additional info please contact dominic.cyr@canada.ca.
